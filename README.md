Description:
This application allows the user to play music.

Functionality:
- The user is allowed to add music to the applications own music library and play them.
- The added music will appear in a table view.
- Shuffle toggle allows users to play songs in random order and if toggled off, it will play in order.
- There is a seek slider you can use to skip ahead or go back on the current song.
- Standard play/pause buttons, as well as back and forth buttons ( Goes back to the previous song, or skips to the next).
- Volume slider and mute toggle. Allows you to adjust the volume with a slider and mute/unmute with a toggle button.
- Displays the Album art, Album Name, Artist Name, and the Songs name.
- Double-Click the row of a song you want to listen to and play.
- Pressing the headers on the table view automatically sorts by name or duration.

Known bugs: 
- There is an issue with the seek slider, if you press rapidly underneath the line it will make the song stutter.
- Even though a song can be x minutes long, some extra seconds get added on and thus the player will have a few seconds of silence.
- You unfortunately have to close and reopen the program for a songs duration to be displayed.
- Duration is displayed as a decimal rather than your standard HH:mm:ss.
